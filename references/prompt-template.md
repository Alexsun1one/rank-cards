# Prompt Template

Generate one card at a time.

## Planning Template

```text
Use $rank-cards. First plan, do not generate yet.

Ranking idea:
{who/what is ranked, and the angle}

Platform:
{视频号/抖音/小红书 3:4 / grid 1:1 / YouTube 16:9}

Return:
- domain
- ranking question
- scope (现役/历史 · 位置 · 俱乐部/国家队 · 巅峰/生涯)
- basis (printed line, optional weights)
- tier system & tiers
- subjects: name | tier | era/jersey/photo choice
- layout archetype
- portrait pipeline (crop/background/treatment/edge/register)
- typography plan
- final generation prompt
- QA risks
```

## Production path (decide first)

- **Path A — real people / public figures**: prefer one unified illustrated or editorial card
  generated with native typography. The image model should render the title, basis, tier labels,
  names, and short chips directly on the card. Use a single portrait treatment for all subjects.
  If the user explicitly provides licensed/owned cutout photos or demands exact photo collage,
  that photo-compositing route is a separate post-production request; do not make it the default.
- **Path B — generated/illustrated subjects**: use the full prompt below and render every
  subject in one pass.

Text rule (both paths): rank cards should ship as finished native typographic images by
default. Ask the model to render the title, basis line, tier labels, names, and short chips
directly when generating the card. Keep labels short and consistent, and repair/regenerate if
glyphs fail. Empty plates plus external overlay are allowed only when the user explicitly asks
for editable/post-production text.

## Final Generation Prompt

```text
Generate one professional ranking / tier card in the Rank Cards style.

Aspect ratio:
{3:4 vertical 1080×1440 / 1:1 / 16:9}

Title:
"{headline, e.g. 历史最强后卫 · 段位排名}"

Basis line — render this exact text:
"{e.g. 按巅峰统治力排名 · 仅限现役中后卫 · 个人向}"

Domain:
{足球 / 篮球 / 作家 / 音乐家 / 导演 / 科学家 / 角色 / 产品}

Layout archetype:
{podium / versus / pyramid / single-hero / tier-row / grid}

Tiers (parallel-form labels, warm→cool, top tier scarce):
- {S / 神}: {subject(s)} — red
- {A / 天王}: {subjects} — orange
- {B / 一流}: {subjects} — yellow
- {C / 二流}: {subjects} — green
{3-6 tiers}

Portrait pipeline — apply IDENTICALLY to every subject (faces):
- crop: all {head-and-shoulders / chest-up}, eyelines aligned, faces same scale
- background: one shared {solid / single gradient}, every subject knocked out onto it
- treatment: one {duotone (shadows→{colorA}, highlights→{colorB}) / matched key light} for all
- edge: all {clean cutout / same tier-colored ring}
- art register: all {photographic-realistic / illustrated} — never mixed
- era/affiliation: {peak-era / current}; {peak-club jersey / national}; held for everyone

Subject-image pipeline — for NO-FACE domains (schools / cities / majors / products):
- same subject-image type: all {crests / skylines / icons / product renders}
- same frame size, same backdrop, same treatment, one art register
- the five locks on a logo/landmark/icon instead of a face — no eyelines, no face scale

Typography:
- title heaviest, top
- tier labels bold in colored caps
- every subject name same size and baseline, high-contrast plate, legible at thumbnail
- big rank numerals outlined to read on portraits
- basis/scope line small but present
- optional 2-4 stat chips per subject ({金球×8} etc.)
- tiny source/disclaimer in a corner

Style:
- unified, designed, authoritative — not a collage of scraped photos
- consistent saturation; the tier ramp carries the color
- one focal structure; generous spacing
- no mismatched crops/backgrounds/art styles, no default tier-maker chrome, no low-res faces
- correct, clean Chinese characters — no melted, doubled, or gibberish glyphs

Quality target:
publish-grade ranking card; every portrait looks shot in one studio; basis stated; readable at a 2cm thumbnail.
```

## Text-Fix Edit Prompt

When the composition is good but text or a portrait is off:

```text
Use $rank-cards to edit this card.

Keep:
- the layout, tier structure, and color ramp

Fix:
- re-render the title and basis line as EXACTLY: "{title}" / "{basis}", clean Chinese characters
- make every subject name the same size and baseline, high-contrast, readable at thumbnail
- pull {subject} back through the portrait pipeline: same crop / background / duotone / edge as the rest
- remove any leftover original photo background or hallucinated watermark/logo
```

If the model cannot render clean Chinese after repair, simplify the labels or regenerate with
stronger typography constraints. Use empty name/title plates for editor overlay only when the
user explicitly chooses that production path.
